*Randomly select 4 playing cards from a deck of cards. Show them to the player. 
Ask the player to memorise a card and tell them you will make it disappear. Ask the user if they are ready.
If they are, generate 4 *new* (i.e., different) playing cards and show them. Ask if you have successfully removed their card.
This is not so much a game as it is a gimmick. If you think this is too simple, feel free to come up with a new game.*
