Mind reader

Randomly select 4 playing cards from a deck of cards. Show them to the player. 
Ask the player to memorise a card and tell them you will make it disappear. Ask the user if they are ready.
If they are, generate 4 *new* (i.e., different) playing cards and show them. Ask if you have successfully removed their card.
This is not so much a game as it is a gimmick. If you think this is too simple, feel free to come up with a new game.

Example

Program: 
 4H   8C 10S   AS
 Memorise a card and I will make it disappear.
Player presses enter. 

Program:
 AH  10H  JC   9Q

 Did I remove the card you thought of? 

Player  : Y
Program : I'm the best mind reader and I have just blown your mind!

To make it harder to spot the fact that all cards have been changed, you could try to pick similar cards.
